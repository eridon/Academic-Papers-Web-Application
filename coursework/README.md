# Web Application Coursework Project

This repository contains the code for a web application developed as part of a assignment for an undergraduate web development module. The application presents information about research papers presented in the academic conference "CHI Play" in 2021. The goal of the project was to create a functional and efficient solution to a real-world problem using web development technologies.

# Features

- The web API was built using object-oriented PHP, which communicates with a database to output information about the research papers in JSON format.
- The front-end of the application was built using React, which communicates with the web API to display information about the research papers.
- User authentication and authorization was implemented to ensure secure access to the application.
- Detailed documentation of the completed system is included in the repository.

# Contents

- Source code - The code for the web application, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
- Documentation - Detailed documentation of the web application, including the problem it solves, the design and implementation details, and the testing process.
